# Crypto Wrapper

High-level command line tool for *Turris* devices to query cryptographic
functions and device info stored during production. This command unifies
hardware-specific commands such as `atsha204cmd` for *Turris 1.x* and
*older Omnia*, `omnia-mcutool` for *newer Omnia*, and `mox-otp` for
*MOX*.
